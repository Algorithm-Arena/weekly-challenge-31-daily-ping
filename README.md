# Weekly Challenge #31 - Daily Ping

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that lets you record daily updates.** For many years I would use a tool that sends me an email every day asking what I've been up to and then lets you aggregate it over a long time period. Sadly it stopped working so this challenge is for you to build a new one!

### Winners:

* The winner for $75 is @Krayorn! The way you insert yourself in the workflow to get people to fill in is really important, having it be a Chrome Extension is very smart! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-31-daily-ping/issues/2
